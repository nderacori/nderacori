- 👋 Hi, I'm Corina. I am a student, getting started on the universe of programming. 
- I am very persistent and curious about what I like, I’m constantly studying and researching. 
- 
- 👀 I love to create, so programming excites me.
- 
- 🌱 Right now I am focused on Database, Big Data and Back-end but, taking it step by step my idea is to learn everything that adds up to my knowledge on programming.
- I want to work in a company that has a self-improving approach and above all that takes its employees into account, on a stable and responsible team with clear objective..
- 
- 💞️ I still don't have experience in this sector, so I would love more than anything to work as a Trainee to help me understand the work process before starting as a Junior.
- 
- Technologies: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, Vue, SQL, Python, Django, Flask, GIT
- Visual Studio Code, NetBeans, MySQL Workbench, Scrum, GitHub
- 
- 📫 Would you like to know more about me?
